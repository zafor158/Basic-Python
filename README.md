# Basic-Python
Python is a high-level, versatile programming language that has gained immense popularity since its inception in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum. It is renowned for its simplicity and readability, making it an ideal choice for both beginners and experienced developers

# Lab-1: Python Tutorial With Google Colab
# Introduction
Python is a great general-purpose programming language on its own, but with the help of a few popular libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib) it becomes a powerful environment for scientific computing.

We expect that many of you will have some experience with Python and numpy; for the rest of you, this section will serve as a quick crash course both on the Python programming language and on the use of Python for scientific computing.

In this lab, we will cover:

* Basic Python: Basic data types (Containers, Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, Tuples), Functions, Classes
* Numpy: Arrays, Array indexing, Datatypes, Array math, Broadcasting
* Matplotlib: Plotting, Subplots, Images
* IPython: Creating notebooks, Typical workflows

# A Brief Note on Python Versions
As of January 1, 2020, Python has officially dropped support for python2. We'll be using Python 3.7 for this iteration of the course. You can check your Python version at the command line by running python --version. In Colab, we can enforce the Python version by clicking Runtime -> Change Runtime Type and selecting python3. Note that as of April 2020, Colab uses Python 3.6.9 which should run everything without any errors.
